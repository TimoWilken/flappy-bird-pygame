# Flappy Bird (using Pygame) 

A clone of the popular app *Flappy Bird*, using Pygame.

This code is forked from https://github.com/TimoWilken/flappy-bird-pygame 

## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing `↑` (up), `⏎`
(return), `␣` (space), or clicking into the window. Don't crash into any pipes!
For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.
